a standalone python program, mavlink integration lateron
- camera interface
- streaming interface can be embedded in the camera objects 
  - allowing all cameras to talk either MJPEG or h264, I don't think anything more 
    than that is needed gstreamer can take care of it.
  - adaptiveness in h264 and MJPEG coming later. 
  - recording should be impliented from day one. intially the recorded stream and 
    trasnmitted stream has to be same. But needs to be decoupled later on as Recording 
    should be highest quality possible and streaming should be adaptive. 
    Most cameras will take care of this anyway as they will record highest quality 
    and give low quality on live view
- should understand mavlink lateron. Don't have enough clarity on that. 
  Anyway making it a mavlink component will be easy lateron. First get everything working
- supported cameras from day one - sony qx series, sony block camera, sony camcorder, 
  raspberry pi cam, FLIR Lepton and SJCAM wifi. In case of multiple camera objects exist, 
  code should take care of firing them together or in parallel as most give API that is sync 
  and waiting for one to return before firing another one will be disastorous.
